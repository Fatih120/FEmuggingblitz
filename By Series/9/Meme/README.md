**Item #:** SCP-F3U
**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-F3U is to be kept in a standard hacking folder and fed FE8 Reskins regularly. The folder is to be monitored by one hacker at all times.

In the event of a containment breach, forum personnel are required to detain SCP-F3U if at all possible; however, if personnel deem SCP-F3U an imminent risk, they are permitted to dispose of it by any means necessary.

**Description:** SCP-F3U is a 128 x 112 px image titled “[REDACTED]”. Created in 2015 by FE Hacker [DATA EXPUNGED], the original image possesses memetic properties that trigger acute paranoia and lingering psychological effects when viewed for too long or from a distance of approximately three meters or less. The portrait depicts a man with a poorly spliced helmet on his head with the addition of eyes staring back at the viewer.

Those who have viewed the portrait for too long or include the portrait in their FE Hack become subject to the delusion that any being or depiction of a being with eyes is staring at them. In extreme cases, subjects report that characters in their hack are making eye contact and are communicating directly to them.
