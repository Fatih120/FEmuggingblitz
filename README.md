# Fire Emblem Mugging Blitz

## What's a Blitz?

In the Fire Emblem GBA hacking communities, bi-annual "Blitzes" are started where the goal is to amass as many Free-to-Use mugs (insertable portraits) made by the community for the sake of having assets that those who aren't confident in their spriting can use. This repository is simply an easy place to grab every single image that has been shared across all the blitzes.

## Terms of Use

The use of any of these images were uploaded and shared in good faith by the original creators of said portraits. That said, they have guidelines that we wish you respect for whatever hacking project you proceed to use any of them in. These are:

 * the freedom to use these mugs in any way for your hack(s)
 * the freedom to edit and/or modify these mugs directly
 * the obligation to credit the original creator of said mug(s), regardless if they are modified or not
 * the obligation to contact the original creator if said mugs are used outside of FEGBA hacks since such intentions are outside the scope of the initial reason of the Blitzes
 
In short, please credit anyone you have borrowed works from, for even a simple thing as a listed username is enough to satisfy and brighten someone's day.

## Organization

Mugs are currently stored in a duplicate system, with one directory being mugs that are sorted by appearance of their blitzes (which nine have been done so far), and the other being mugs organized by the creator.
The mugs themselves will be further organized within these folders. Requants or "meme" edits that are not strikingly in FEGBA style will be in a sub-folder while all the other portraits will be in the root folders (this does not apply to the By Creator folder).

## Downloading

Since there are two folders which will have the same exact amount of mugs, there is no reason to clone the entire repository. Simply go to the [releases](https://github.com/Fatih120/FEmuggingblitz/releases/) page and choose the download for either By Series or By Creator. After that, hack away.

## Additions

Since this is not much of a code repository as much as it is a gallery, there will be no need for pull requests or the sort - however, this repo will be updated at the end of every Blitz. If you have a mug you wish to add that hasn't been in a Blitz, you can feel free to contact me at Fatih#4806 on Discord and I can work something out for you.

Lastly, if you want a purely visual look-and-grab repository, you can visit http://mof.x10.bz/projects/fegba/blitz for a wall of mugs. This will eventually load every single mug in a directory, so this will be a few megabytes large to load.
